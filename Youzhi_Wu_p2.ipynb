    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "> **ANSWER**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?**\n",
    "   - The feature dimensions (vocabulary) in our case are high, which makes distance measuring hard. All neighbors converge so close that it is tricky to clearly identify nearest versus farthest neighbors. \n",
    "   - <font color=red> Feature dimensions is much larger than data size which could skew towards unimportant features.</font>\n",
    "        \n",
    "> **b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?**\n",
    "   - Naive Bayes works good in domains with many equally important features. The main assumption behind the naive bayes model is that each feature $x_i$ is conditionally independent of all other features given the class. This assumption is naive and basically impossible to meet, however, it helps the naive bayes model generalize well and works well in high dimension. Instead of learning and estimating a complicated, high dimensional distribution: $P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, c)$ in which all of the features are jointly distributed, the model can be trained by estimating $P(x_1, c)$, $P(x_2, c)$, ..., $P(x_n, c)$.\n",
    "   - It also works good in case of small data size. General ML algorithms require $2^k$ data points to perform well versus Naive Bayes requires only $k$.\n",
    "        \n",
    "> **c. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.**\n",
    "   - The sum increases as the value C increases. C is the inverse of Lambda regulator, which means, lowering C would increase Lambda regulator strength. Increasing the regularization strength penalizes \"large\" weight coefficients so that the model can improve its generalization performance. \n",

The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",

    "> **ANSWER**: \n",
    "   - CountVectorizer counts the word frequencies; whereas, TfidfVectorizer normalizes the results by the frequency of the word in the corpus, in which IDF stands for \"inverse document frequency\". Essentially, TfidfVectorizer combines both CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer. The reason for the normalization is that often in a document, several common words appear frequently but carry very little information about the content. If these counts are directly fed to a classifier, these meaningless common words will shadow the real interesting terms of the document. Therefore, we can choose TfidfVectorizer to re-weight count feature vectors using tf-idf transform method and then feed the data into classifier for better classification. \n",
    "   - By looking through the top three mistakes, two of the \"talk.religion.misc\" cases are mistaken as \"comp.graphics\", which is probably caused by words such as \"site\", \"online\", \"ftp\", etc. Our predictor characterize the document class in a rather superficial manner: rather than combining words to understand the deeper context of each document, it just looks at words individually. One way to address the issue could be using bigram or trigram. \n",
    "   - Because of the way TfidfVectorizer calculates frequency, common words are likely to be treated as noise, which then increases the signal of some non-common words, such as ftp. Another way to tackle the issue could be adding stop words to the vectorizer. Nowadays, words such as \"site\", \"online\", \"drive\", \"ftp\", etc. are quite common in office/school communications, which actually do not carry much meaning in terms of labeling document. These words could be added to stop words list.  "
